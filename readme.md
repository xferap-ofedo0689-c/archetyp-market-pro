## About Archetyp Market
Archetyp was set up by YosemiteGhostWrite, who'd been a Dread moderator for a long time. It was originally set up as a European-only market (that's why vendor bonds are in Euros), but it later expanded to welcome vendors and buyers worldwide. Despite a slow start, it really took off after the closure of the now legendary White House Market, which itself was also a Monero-only market. The Archetyp team had a bit of a falling out with AlphaBay head honcho DeSnake, but they managed to outlast AlphaBay and have gone from strength to strength since its demise. It's now one of the biggest darknet markets, but it's only for drugs. If you're looking for credit cards, digital goods or counterfeits, you'll need to look elsewhere.
